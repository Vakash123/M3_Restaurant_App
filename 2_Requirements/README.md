# Description
* I have designed an application for small scale restaurant owners who can't afford more budget on billing software. It is accessible to users 24*7. Now a days, many software providing apps charge more amount, that small scale businesses can't afford. This project will help them with cost efficiency and Time management.

# Research
* Inoicing is the preliminary step of receiving payment;an invoice is made for every product or service sold or supplied.The times when payments were processed mainly in cash and transactions were recorded in books are long gone. In order to combact error invoicing and overdue accounts payable, modern businesses have adapted the financial technologies (e-transfer, card payment, online payments). SME's now enjoy the enormous advantages of the billing system, especially in terms of quick gains. Billing software saves printing and postage costs, reduces deadlines, and streamlines business workflow through unified invoicing processing. Efficiency gains and cost-saving are the most crucial advantages of billing system.
