# M3_Restaurant_Bill

* I have designed an application for small scale restaurant owners who can't afford more budget on billing software. It is accessible to users 24*7. Now a days, many software providing apps charge more amount, that small scale businesses can't afford. This project will help them with cost efficiency and Time management.
